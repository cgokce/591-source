- Primitive array, can support both primitives or objects, size is limited

        int[] myArr = new int[10];
        // Sorting
        import java.util.Arrays;
        Arrays.sort(myArr);


- Array List, only accepts the object types
- It was derived from the List interface

        ArrayList<Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();
        myList.add();
        myList.get();
        myList.set(0, newVal);

### Python notes
- We only have dynamic list, supports both indexing and appending
- python only have object types so it supports everything

        myList = []
        myList.append(val)
        res = myList.pop()
        res = myList[0]
