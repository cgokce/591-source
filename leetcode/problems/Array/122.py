Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
<T> Array <T> Greedy

int [] prices
    - ith element is the price of a given stock on day i

Find the maximum profit
    - As many transactions as time
    - Can't do multiple transactions
    - Buy one sell one at a time

Strategy

You get first one as base
    - When dipping -> move base next
    - When starting upward -> Mark that as to sell
        - If starts dipping, sell it
