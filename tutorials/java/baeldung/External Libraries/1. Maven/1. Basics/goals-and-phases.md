#### Goals and Phases

    https://www.baeldung.com/maven-goals-phases

Maven Build Lifecycle
- Build follows a specific life cycle to deploy and distribute the target project
    - default: main life cycle responsible to deployment
    - clean: clean project and remove all files generated by prev build
    - site: generate projects site documentation

Maven Phase
- Each lifecycle contain phases, eg default have 23 phasese
- Representing a stage in the Maven build lifecycle, executed in specific order
- We can run a stage, and all preceeding stages with `mvn <PHASE>`

        mvn deploy

Maven Goal
- Each phase is sequence of goals and each goal is responsible for a specific task
- Eg. some phases and goals, compiler:compile, compiler:testCompile, surefire:test, install:install

Maven Plugin
- Group of goals, aren't necessarily bound to the same phase
- Eg. for failsafe plugin responsible for integration tests

        <build><plugins><plugin>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>${maven.failsafe.version}</version>
            <executions><execution>
                <goals>
                    <goal>integration-test</goal>
                    <goal>verify</goal>
                </goals>
        ...

- Too see all of the goals in failsafe plugin

        mvn failsafe:help
        // To run specific goal
        mvn plugin:goal

Building a Maven Project
- We need to execute on of the lifecycles by running one phases
- We usually use `mvn clean install`, clean before the new build
